- The Moon and Sixpence

The adulation of his admirers is perhaps no less capricious than the disparagement of his detractors

His decent reticence is branded as hypocrisy, his circumlocutions are roundly called lies, and his silence is vilified as treachery.

The mystic sees the ineffable, and the psycho-pathologist the unspeakable.

Heaven knows what pains the author has been at, what bitter experiences he has endured and what heartache suffered
